# Final Project

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.	Familiarize students with **2D Arrays**
3.	Provide students with continued practice using **everything!**
   
## Important Notes
1.	**Filename**: Save your program as `batship.c`

# Program
Batship! (half of battleship)

## Background
This project is loosely based on the game of Battleship (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). However, we will only be implementing half of the game.

## Behavior
- The first time the user starts the program, they should begin playing the Batship game.
- Game play consists of prompting a user for where they'd like to "fire" on the opposing player. If they've hit part of a ship, they will see an `X` in that spot. If it's a miss, they will see a `O`. All other spots will be blank until fired upon. 
   - Game play should continue until all parts of every ship have been "hit".
- After the game is done, the user should be shown their score and prompted to play again.
   - The score should start with 100. The number of guess should be deducted then the number of spots required to sink all the ships can be added back to the score.
      - For example, if it took the exact number of guesses to hit all the spots, the score would be 100.

## Requirements
- **You may *NOT* use any libraries other than `stdio` and `stdbool`.**
- There must be ***at least*** 5 functions, in addition to the main (my program had 6)
- Any 2D arrays must be used in the conventional way
   - index values should start a 0 and end at size - 1 
- If the user's move has values outside of the acceptable range, they should be prompted to enter their move until the values are within range.

### Extra Credit
#### Extra Credit tasks will not be considered for grading unless all other requirements have been met.
Choose *one* option from the following: 
- The user may be prompted for a difficulty level. The higher the difficulty, the fewer the ships on the board. *HINT: this requires different files with different ship layouts.*
- After completing a game, the player's name and score is added to a file and an option to view scores is added to a menu.

## Hints
- use the ASCII table (https://www.asciitable.com/) to think of an easy way to transform the column letter into an index integer
- the spots the user guesses is different data than where the ships are located
   - so they should be stored separately

## Example Program Execution
An example executable is provided in this repository.
- You should be able to run it from your project folder in a Linux environment. 
- If you encounter a “permission denied” error when attempting to run the executable, type  
```chmod u+x batshipExecutable```  
into the terminal and try running the executable again.
