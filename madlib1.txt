It was a
A
, cold November day. I woke up to the
A
smell of
N
roasting in the
N
downstairs. I went down the stairs to see if I could help
V
the breakfast. My mom said, "See if your dad needs a fresh
N
." so I carried a tray of mugs full of
N
into the living room. When I got there I couldn't believe my
N
! There were
N
all over the
N
!
